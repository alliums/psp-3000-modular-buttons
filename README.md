Modular buttons for the PSP 3000. The goal of this project is to overcome the difficulties of creating custom buttons for the PSP Slim by circumventing the reliance on glued silicon baseplates. Includes a 3d printable baseplate, square button, and round buttons.

Requires a 3d printer and 4x 4mm OD springs. 
Simply print the components, remove the silicone button assembly from your PSP, and replace with the baseplate. Insert the springs into each hole, put the buttons on top, close the faceplate.
0 guarantee this works at all. 

Tolerances on buttons may need adjustment to fit properly. Uses 4x 4mm OD springs.

Long live the PSP!!!
